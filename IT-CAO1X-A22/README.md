<b>Version</b><br>
3.0

<b>Offered by</b><br>
ICT Engineering

<b>ECTS</b><br>
5

<b>Prerequisites</b><br>
None

<b>Main purpose</b><br>
The main purpose is to gain a basic understanding of the organization and design of computers and how a computer works. There will be a focus on the central processing unit (CPU) and the necessary logic involved in building a CPU.

<b>Knowledge</b><br>
Having completed this course, the student is able to:

- Describe and apply numbering representations, including twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers in the binary numbering representation
- Identify the functionality of basic logic gates and be able to combine them into half- and full-adders, flip/flops, etc.
- Describe Boolean algebra and its relation to digital circuits
- Describe the architecture of simple CPUs and how they function, explain the build and working behavior of basic building blocks of CPUs (registers, ALUs, etc.)

<b>Skills</b><br>
Having completed this course, the student should be able to:

- Create functioning assembler programs for microcontrollers
- Analyse ASM programs (AVR MCU) and calculate execution time
- Execute and debug assembler programs
- Analyze and describe simple logical circuits (Boolean expressions)
- Apply Boolean algebra to reduce digital circuits.

<b>Competences</b><br>
Having completed this course, students should be able to:

- Describe the functionality of the components of basic computer architectures
- Apply mathematical theory to understand low-level computer architecture and programming
- Create simple logic circuits used in CPUs
- Create applications using assembler programming
- Integrate simple I/O devices in embedded applications.

<b>Topics</b><br>

<b>Teaching methods and study activities</b><br>
The required workload for students is estimated at 137 hours where approximately 41 hours (55 lessons of 45 minutes) are in category 1 and 2 of the Student Activity Model.

<b>Resources</b><br>

<b>Evaluation</b><br>

<b>Examination</b><br>
<u>Exam prerequisites:</u><br>
Two assignments must be approved before attending the exam. The student must have an attendance of at least 75% in order to qualify for the exam. Students who do not have at least 75% attendance will automatically fail the ordinary exam.

<u>Exam type:</u><br>
Written exam, 2 hours<br>
External assessment<br>
The exam is digital and it is the responsibility of the student to bring a computer that works together with Wiseflow and Flowlock.

<u>Tools allowed:</u><br>
Course literature and personal notes.

<u>Re-exam:</u><br>
Similar to the ordinary exam.
Grading criteria
Grading based on the Danish 7-point scale.
