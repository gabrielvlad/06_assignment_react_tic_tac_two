# Tic Tac Toe Game Made in React

This is a Tic Tac Toe game made in React. The game is a two player game. The first player is X and the second player is O. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. The game was made with the help of the React tutorial found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html (I have learned a lot from this tutorial and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning React.)


## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have the following installed:

- nodejs LTS(v18.15.0)
- npm came with nodejs installation, npm LTS (9.5.0)

### Optional but useful for windows users
- nvm-windows LTS(1.1.10) (I found this to be very useful for switching between nodejs versions)
- git bash (Usefull when you only find react guides for linux/mac users)
- prettier (I use this to format my code in vscode)
- eslint (I use this to lint my code in vscode)
- react dev tools (I use this to inspect the react components in the browser, useful for debugging and seeing grid state)

After installing the necessary dependencies, clone the repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

```
cd 06_assignment_react_tic_tac_two
npm install
```
