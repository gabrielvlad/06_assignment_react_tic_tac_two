<b>Version</b><br>
4.0

<b>Offered by</b><br>
ICT Engineering

<b>ECTS</b><br>
10

<b>Prerequisites</b><br>
General admittance requirements.

<b>Main purpose</b><br>
The main purpose of the course is to provide students with the qualifications needed to understand the core object-oriented concepts and to implement smaller programs in Java from UML class diagrams.

<b>Knowledge</b><br>
The student should be able to:
- Identify the Java lexical structures: keywords, separators, operators, identifiers, literals and comments.
- Explain details of UML class diagrams.
- Identify selection and loop structures in UML activity diagrams.

<b>Skills</b><br>
The student should be able to:

- Construct Java programs with proper choice of selection and loop structures.
- Create and use objects in Java.
- Implement classes in Java using the object oriented concepts: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
- Implement one-to-one relations and differentiate between association, aggregation and composition.
- Implement one-to-many relations using array structures and a simple collection class.
- Implement exception handling for different types of exceptions.
- Implement persistence in text and binary files.
- Construct simple event-based GUI applications.
- Construct Java source code documentations.
- Interpret UML class diagrams, and construct corresponding Java code.

<b>Competences</b><br>
The student should be able to:
- Exemplify and discuss basic object-oriented concepts, including encapsulation, relationships, inheritance and polymorphism
- Implement small scale systems from UML class diagrams.

<b>Evaluation</b>

<b>Examination</b><br>
<u>Prerequisites for exam:</u><br>
In order to qualify for the exam, the student must participate in an oral mid-term test half way through the semester. The date will be published at the beginning of the semester.
If students fail to appear for the mid-term test, they must take the mid-term test on class in the first possible session.

The student must have an attendance of at least 75% in order to qualify for the exam. Students who do not have at least 75% attendance will automatically fail the ordinary exam.

<u>Exam type:</u><br>
Individual oral examination where the student will pick an unfamiliar programming exercise at random. The student must explain the UML involved and demonstrate how to perform the programming task using a laptop. The time allotted for the examination is 30 minutes including assessment.

Exam is with an external examiner.

<u>Tools allowed:</u><br>
All.

<u>Re-exam:</u><br>
Same as ordinary exam.

<b>Grading criteria</b><br>
Grading based on the Danish 7-point scale.
